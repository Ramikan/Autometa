# Autometa
Bash Script which automates Metasploit to run some of the commonly used auxiliary, scanner, exploits during vulnerability assessment to make the tester's life easier. Very early stage of developing, so feel free to test it and let me know what can be added into the modules.

# Requirement
Metasploit Framework on the linux OS (Tested on Kali Linux).

# Work To be Done
Add other common modules for web, voip and other services.
